# CMP203 - Graphics Programming 3D - Final project

## Module CMP203 - Graphics Programming Description
Abertay University - 2nd year module

### Module Aim
Learn skills and techniques associated with 3D graphics, applying this knowledge to develop 3D applications using OpenGL, increasing abilities as a C++ programmer.

### Module Topics
1. Intro to 3D Graphics
2. Transformation (Matrices in 3D Graphics, Model Matrix) + Hierarchical modelling (Matrix Stack)
3. Lighting (Real world & real-time 3d graphics)
   1. Flat shading, Gouraud Shading & Phong Shading.
   2. Directional Ligth, Spot Light, Point Light
   3. Animating and Controlling lights
   4. Materials
   5. Specular Lighting
   6. Light Attenuation
5. Texturing (Loading, Appling, Enabling Texture mapping, Calculating UVs, Drawing and implementing in OpenGL)
6. Camera (Projection Transformation, Types of camera,  Camera control)
7. Depth Buffer + Transparency
   1. Rasterisation
   2. Depth Sorting
   3. Z-Buffer
   4. Skybox
   5. Aplha blending (transparency)
9. Vertex arrays + procedural generation shape
11. Model loading
12. Stencil buffer (Reflection)
13. Shadows (Pre-calculated and real-time)
    1. Shadow Impostor
    2. Planar Projection Shadows
    3. Stencil Buffer in Projected shadows
    4. Shadow Volumen or Stencil Shadowing (Depth Pass, Depth Fail and Exclusive-or)
    5. Shadow Mapping
       
### Assessment
1. Weekly submitions as part of the lab work for each topic
2. Final Project at the end of the semester (own construction)

## Project Description

3D Graphics Scene using OpenGL
Includes all the diferent types of cameras, dynamic ligh, real-time shadows, reflection and the rendering of different geometries using triangles with optimized number of vertices and also rendering models.
Each class contains a description in a comment at the begining, includying the author and/or by who has been modified and what it does.
Made for Windows DirectX

## Controls

### Camera

To switch between different cameras press from 1 to 8.
1. Middle Front Movible Camera (default)
2. Right Front Security Camera
3. Right Back Security Camera
4. Middle Back Security Camera
5. Left Back Security Camera
6. Top Fixed Camera
7. Spaceship 1 view camera
8. Spaceship 2 view camera

WARNING - Project may need re-targeted to compile. Check the version of the Windows SDK.
